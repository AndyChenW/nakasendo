## 1. Definitions

The term "contribution" is the original Software, or any additions or changes to the Software. A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.  "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patents or claimed patents that read directly on its contribution to the Software (but “licensed patents” do __not__ include a contributor’s patents or claimed patents that do not read directly on its contribution to the Software.) 

## 2. **Grant of Rights**

(A) __Copyright Grant__.  Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create. 

(B) __Patent Grant__.  Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the Software or derivative works of the contribution in the Software.

Except for such right to use the nChain™ and Nakasendo™ trademarks, this license does not grant you rights to use any other contributors' name, logo, or trademarks. 

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the Software, your patent license from such contributor to the Software ends automatically.
